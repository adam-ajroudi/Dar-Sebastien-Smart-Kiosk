# Dar Sebastien - Historical Knowledge Base

## George Sebastian Biography

George Sebastian (1890-1963) was a Romanian-born financier and aesthete who fell in love with Tunisia during his travels in the early 1920s. Born into a wealthy family in Bucharest, Sebastian made his fortune in international banking and became known for his refined artistic taste and extravagant lifestyle.

In 1920, while traveling along the North African coast, Sebastian discovered the small fishing village of Hammamet. Captivated by its pristine beaches, azure Mediterranean waters, and the gentle climate, he decided to build his dream villa there. He purchased land on the shoreline and commissioned the construction of what would become one of the most celebrated private residences in Tunisia.

Sebastian was known for hosting lavish parties attended by the European and American elite of the era. His guests included writers, artists, politicians, and celebrities who were drawn to the villa's unique blend of Art Deco elegance and Mediterranean charm.

## The Villa Architecture

Dar Sebastien was constructed between 1920 and 1927. The villa represents a masterful fusion of traditional Tunisian architecture with European Art Deco influences. The main residence features:

- **The Famous Swimming Pool**: The villa's most iconic feature is its stunning swimming pool, designed by Sebastian himself. The pool features graceful curves inspired by Art Deco design, surrounded by elegant terraces and Mediterranean gardens. Many consider it one of the most beautiful private pools ever built in North Africa.

- **The Garden Terraces**: The villa descends in terraces toward the Mediterranean Sea, with lush gardens featuring bougainvillea, jasmine, oleander, and century-old olive trees. The gardens were designed to create a seamless transition between the built environment and the natural landscape.

- **The Main House**: The residential building combines whitewashed walls typical of Tunisian architecture with elegant archways, ornate tile work, and Art Deco furnishings. Many of the original decorative elements have been preserved.

- **The Open-Air Amphitheater**: Later additions to the property included a magnificent open-air theater with a capacity of approximately 600 seats, carved into the hillside facing the sea. This amphitheater now hosts performances during the annual International Festival of Hammamet.

## Cultural Significance

After Sebastian's death in 1963, the Tunisian government acquired the property. Recognizing its cultural and historical significance, the government designated it as the International Cultural Center of Hammamet (Centre Culturel International de Hammamet).

Since 1964, Dar Sebastien has served as the primary venue for the International Festival of Hammamet, one of the oldest and most prestigious cultural festivals in the Arab world. The festival takes place every summer (typically July and August) and features:

- Classical and contemporary music performances
- Theater productions
- Dance performances

The amphitheater's spectacular setting, with the Mediterranean as its backdrop, creates an unforgettable experience for both performers and audiences.
